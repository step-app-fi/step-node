Node implementation for the Step Network. Step Network EVM chain is powered by Avalanche subnet technology.  Based on the [Avalanche](https://avax.network) node with step [subnet](https://docs.avax.network/subnets) support baked in.

## Installation

Check [avalanchego docs](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego#installation) for hardware requirements.

## Running Step Node from pre-built image

For mainnet use step-node docker tag.

```sh
export TAG=step-node
```

For testnet use step-testnet docker tag.

```sh
export TAG=step-testnet
```

Run node instance

```sh
docker pull stepapp/step-node:$TAG
docker run -v /step-node-db:/root/.avalanchego/db \
  --network=host \
  --name step-node stepapp/step-node:$TAG avalanchego \
  --config-file=/root/.avalanchego/config.json \
  --chain-config-dir=/root/.avalanchego/configs/chains-restricted \
  --public-ip=<your.public.ip.address>
```

## Becoming Step Validator

As well as the main Avalanche networks (X-, P- and C-), Step Network is secured by Avalanche chain validators explicitly configured to validate the subnet.
To become Step validator you should become validator on Avalanche network (Mainnet or Fuji Testnet respectively).

Follow [this guide](https://docs.avax.network/nodes/validate/add-a-validator#fuji-workflow) and execute following steps:

* Run your node as described in previous paragraph
* Save its ID and export staker.crt and staker.key generated by the node (recommended way is to mount staking folder as volume with using -v argument. 

Example:

```sh
docker pull stepapp/step-node:$TAG
docker run -v /step-node-db:/root/.avalanchego/db \
  -v /avalanchego/staking:/root/.avalanchego/staking \
  --network=host \
  --name step-node stepapp/step-node:$TAG avalanchego \
  --config-file=/root/.avalanchego/config.json \
  --chain-config-dir=/root/.avalanchego/configs/chains-restricted \
  --public-ip=<your.public.ip.address>
```

* Stake AVAX using Avalanche wallet as described [here](https://docs.avax.network/nodes/validate/add-a-validator#add-as-a-validator).

Minimal amounts of AVAX:

* 2000 AVAX for mainnet
* 2 AVAX for Fuji testnet

* Wallet will build and execute staking Tx and your node will appear in Pending then current set of validators.
* The node will validate Step Subnet in addition to validating the base Avalanche network.
* After staking period ends your node will leave validator set and receive staking reward (uptime of at least 80% required to be rewarded).
* Restake your assets for the next period.
