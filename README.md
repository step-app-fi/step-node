Node implementation for the Step Network. Step Network EVM chain is powered by Avalanche subnet technology.  Based on the [Avalanche](https://avax.network) node with step [subnet](https://docs.avax.network/subnets) support baked in.

## Installation

Check [avalanchego docs](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego#installation) for hardware requirements.

## Running Step Node from pre-built image

```sh
docker pull step/step-node
docker run -v /step-node-db:/root/.avalanchego/db \
  --network=host \
  --name step-node step/step-node:latest avalanchego \
  --config-file=/root/.avalanchego/config.json \
  --chain-config-dir=/root/.avalanchego/configs/chains-restricted \
  --public-ip=<your.public.ip.address>
```

## Becoming Step Validator

As well as the main Avalanche networks (X-, P- and C-), Step Network is secured by Avalanche chain validators explicitly configured to validate the subnet. To become step validator you should become validator on Avalanche network (Fuji Testnet).

Follow [this guide](https://docs.avax.network/nodes/validate/add-a-validator#fuji-workflow) and execute following steps:

* Run your node as described in previous paragraph
* Save its ID and export staker.crt and staker.key generated by the node (recommended way is to mount staking folder as volume with using -v argument. Example: `-v /avalanchego/staking:/root/.avalanchego/staking`).
* Generate your Private key, get your X-fuji address from it and stake using Avalanche wallet as described [here](https://docs.avax.network/nodes/validate/add-a-validator#add-as-a-validator). Amount of 2 AVAX is enough for Fuji.
* Wallet will build and execute staking Tx and your node will appear in pending then current set of validators.
* After staking period ends your node will leave validator set and receive staking reward (uptime of at least 80% required to be rewarded).
* Restake your assets for the next period.
